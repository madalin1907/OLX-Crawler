# OLX Crawler

## Before using the crawler, you will need to install these:
1. Visual Studio Code + Live Server extension.
2. Python 3.10 + 'requests', 'bs4' (or 'BeautifulSoup4') and 'concurrent.futures' libraries (Use command *pip install \<library name\>* in terminal to install a library).
3. Node.js + 'express' module (Use command *npm install \<module name\>* to install a module).


## To use the crawler, follow these steps:

1. Open the project folder with Visual Studio Code.
2. Open a terminal and use *cd Server* to reach the **Server** folder path.
4. Use command "node server.js" to start the server.
5. Open *OLX.html* file from **ResultsWebPage** folder using Live Server.

The Crawler will automatically run in the opened webpage. If you want to use the Crawler multiple times, just refresh the webpage (**Don't refresh it while the Crawler is running to avoid possible errors!**).
